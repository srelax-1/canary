# Additional Observations
observations:
  unexpected_behaviors:  I encountered challenge with getting metrics from the grafana dashboard and prometheus UI both showing no data. Also I did not get any error and was unable to debug the issue but that to a solution from one course buddy in the channel. #TODO: List any unexpected behaviors you observed
  suggested_improvements: I don't think I have much to say about areas of improvement. #TODO: List any improvements you would suggest
